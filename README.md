# PowerBI--Business-Analysis
I reviewed the internet sales of a company using Microsoft SQL server and reported the findings using a Powerbi dashboard.

Goals: 
1) To be able to follow up Products that sell the most
2) To be able to follow better which customers and products sell the best
3) To be able to follow sales over time against budget

SQL server tasks:
* Data cleansing and transformation:

- Relabel
- Remove unnecessary columns
- Check formats of the columns of use
- Create LEFT or other joins to get ‘may be useful’ data columns from other tables 
- Use CASE to decode data in encoded columns, e.g, Gender
- Use ISNULL to to deal with null values

* Define keys and establish relationships between the cleaned tables
